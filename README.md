# GAUDIE: Development, Validation and Exploration of a Naturalistic German AUDItorily Emotional Database
Since thoroughly validated naturalistic affective German speech stimulus database are rare, we present here a novel validated database of speech sequences assembled with the purpose of emotion induction. The database comprises 37 audio speech sequences for the induction of positive, neutral, and negative emotion: comedian shows intending to elicit humorous and amusing feelings, weather forecast, and arguments between couples and relatives from movies or television series. Multiple continuous and discrete ratings are used to validate the database to capture the time course and variabilities of valence and arousal. We analyse and quantify how well the audio sequences fulfil quality criteria of differentiation, salience/strength, as well as generalizability across participants. Hence, we provide a validated speech database of naturalistic scenarios suitable to investigate emotion processing and its time course with German speaking participants.

# Git Repository
The Git Repository comprises scripts to preprocessed the GAUDIE database audio sequences using among others the toolbox librosa as well as to processed the data collected in the validation study.
